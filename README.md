## 📜 About The Project

Sylvan is a GameFi experiment designed to solve the "Death Spiral" of P2E economies. Instead of infinite inflation, we introduce **Mortal Assets**.
Every Land plot decays over time. Players must burn tokens (Resources) to maintain their yield.

**Core Loop:**
1.  **Reclaim:** Activate dead lands.
2.  **Heal:** Burn tokens to restore "Health Bar".
3.  **Harvest:** Earn yield only from healthy lands.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project is built using the **Solana Anchor Framework**.

*   **Smart Contracts:** Rust (Anchor)
*   **Frontend:** React + Vite / TypeScript
*   **Integration:** Solana Wallet Adapter (Phantom/Solflare)
*   **Testing:** Mocha / Chai

  ## 🔒 Security & Audit
* This is currently an MVP / Pre-Alpha build running on Testnet.
* Formal audit is scheduled post-fundraise.
* Use at your own risk during the testing phase.
